         * @brief Parses a buffer into tokens while stripping comments and tracking line/column positions.
         *
         * This function performs a single pass over the input buffer:
         * - Skips both `// line` and C-style block comments.
         * - Skips whitespace while tracking line and column numbers.
         * - Splits the text into tokens separated by whitespace.
         * - Optionally fills an array of Token objects with start/end pointers and source position info.
         *
         * @param buffer    The modifiable input buffer (null-terminated). Comments are replaced with spaces.
         * @param tokens    Optional pointer to an array of Token objects. If `nullptr`, only token counting is performed.
         * @param maxCount  Maximum number of tokens that can be written to `tokens`.
         * @return          Number of tokens found, or -1 if `tokens` is not `nullptr` and more than `maxCount` tokens were detected.
         *
         * @note The function does not allocate memory; it works directly on the provided buffer.
         * @note If `tokens` is provided, the caller must ensure it has at least `maxCount` capacity.
         * @note If only the count is needed, call with `tokens = nullptr` and `maxCount = 0`.
