was earlier called - esp-wifi_env_sensor 

This project provides a flexible hardware and device abstraction framework for ESP32, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi Pico, and Linux.

* JSON-based configuration: Easily define hardware and virtual devices.

* Hybrid HAL/DAL system: Supports direct hardware access (GPIO, ADC, IÂ²C, SPI, PWM) and logical/virtual devices.

* Script engine: Compile scripts to fast indirect dispatch with function pointers and device contexts.

* Cross-platform: Runs on microcontrollers and Linux, enabling unified device management and IoT integration (e.g., Thingspeak uploads).

Ideal for building modular, multi-device IoT projects and automation systems with minimal platform-specific code.

# License

This repository uses a mixed-license approach:

- **GPL v3** for the core HAL/DAL and script engine files.  
- **MIT** for device registration files:  
  - HAL_JSON_DeviceTypesRegistry.cpp  
  - HAL_JSON_I2C_BUS_DeviceTypeReg.cpp  

currently a work in progress
but when finished:
It will be a better variant to tasmota and espeasy,
specially when using sensors
as the codebase is much easier to understand,
and is easier to add functionality.

**dependencies**<br>
special version of TimeAlarms<br>
that can have any amount of alarms (up to 255)<br>
and also can use parameters when calling handler functions<br>
note. this dependency is included in platformio.ini and is automatically installed<br>
